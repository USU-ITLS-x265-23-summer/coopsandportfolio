        <h2>Graphic Design Pieces</h2>
        <p>This page is dedicated to all the images I have created in my Graphic Design course(s) here at Utah State.
            Each image was edited in Adobe Photoshop.

    <h3>Paintbrush Techniques</h3>
    <p>For this piece, I wanted to utilize the paintbrush tools inside of Adobe Photoshop to make the image appear as
        if it were painted.

    <h3>Overlays and Layer Adjustments</h3>
    <p>For this image I set out to create a unique piece that utilized various overlays, blending modes, and layer adjustments.
        This is one of my favorite pieces I have ever created.

    <h3>Flyer</h3>
    <p>I decided that I wanted to create a flyer to fit this image of space that I found on Unsplash. I wanted to practice using contrast and 
        repitition to create an appealing flyer.
    </p>

    <h3>Postcard</h3>
    <p>I felt inspired by this image that I took on a trip to Hawaii, so I created this postcard. I utilized auto-fill tools to remove bystanders and clutter,
        leaving me with a picture-perfect beach scene.
    </p>

    <h3>Bokeh Effects and General Edit</h3>
    <p>I wanted to add a touch of a bokeh effect to these lights, and make the image feel more dynamic and visually interesting.</p>

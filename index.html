        <h2>Hi, I'm Cooper!</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Cooper Sanders, and I am a student at Utah State University.
            I am currently an Undergraduate in the Human Experience Design and
            Interaction Program. After I graduate, I hope to work as a UX 
            or Instructional Designer.
        </p>

        <p>
            In my freetime, I enjoy reading, playing video games, and spending time with my partner.
        </p>

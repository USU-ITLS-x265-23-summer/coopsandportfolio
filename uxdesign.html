        <h2>UX Design Pieces</h2>
        <p> I am passionate about UX design, and hope to work as a designer in the future. Here are two of my pieces. </p>
        <h3>Foundation Website</h3>
        <img class="UXimg" src="assets/UX_Design/FoundationHomepage.jpg" alt="The homepage of the Foundation website I created.">
        <p> I created this piece to solve a problem I experience in my day-to-day life. My apartment complex only allows
            tenants to pay rent via check. This is a very outdated process, so I designed a custom website to solve this
            problem, and a couple other issues I felt needed addressing. The PDF below showcases the research I conducted
            on the audience, and the process I took to creating my final, high-fidelity prototype.

        <img class="UXimg" src="assets/UX_Design/RedesignHomepage.png" alt="The homepage of the website I redesigned.">
        <p> In this piece, I was tasked to redesign a website that I have used out of a list of local businesses. below
            is a PDF file showcasing my design process from start to finish for this site.
